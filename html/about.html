				<p>Milled Fibers are used as reinforcement and filler medium in plastic composites, adhesives and coatings to enhance mechanical properties, increase modulus, improve dimensional stability and minimize distortiomaterials such as polyester, phenolic, silicones and epoxy. Milled Fibers are also compatible with most asphalt, putties, patching cements and other coatings. </p>
				<p class="dark">Reduction of particle size is an important operation in many chemical and other industries. The important reasons for size reduction are Easy handling, Increase in surface area per unit volume, Separatirition and (4) Cutting. Estimation of energy for the operation is important and is usually done by empirical equations. Enormous quantities of energy are  while less than 1% goes in creating new interfacial area. Reduction to very fine sizes is much costlier in terms of energy as compared to relatively coarse products. </p>
